Hey there, it looks like you want to setup a Vagrant VM to develop [Pebble](https://getpebble.com/) watch faces and apps on.

This is the right place to look!

Once you're done, you should be able to run:

```
$ vagrant up
$ vagrant ssh
vagrant@vagrant-ubuntu-trusty-64:~$ pebble --version
# PebbleSDK 2.9
```

Yep, that's right. [Pebble SDK](https://developer.getpebble.com/) v2.9 in a Vagrant image.

It's not pretty, so pull requests are happily taken.

Use it at your own risk.
